# Equinox
### Chucking!!!
That's right folks, now if you're grabbing an object, you can throw it across the endless cosmos.
Press Q to chuck your newfound item into hopefully something useful like a wall. Places to use items aren't implemented yet, so play catch or something.
I did this in about 2 minutes so if there are any bugs, well you know what to do.

### Enjoy

Surviving space is tough. Surviving after your spaceship is torn to pieces by a barrage of meteors. Well, it is even tougher. In this First Person Puzzler Platformer, you see yourself having to reassemble the wreckage of the Equinox, where due to the lack of gravity (who knew), your only means of traversal is a trusty grapple hook. You will have to attach yourself to asteroids and all kinds of ship debris. Working against the dizziness of space movement and 0G physics, all in the hopes to reconstruct the Equinox once again and kiss this Solar System goodbye.
