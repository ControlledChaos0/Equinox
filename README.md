# Equinox
### Work on the Feature-Grappling Branch. That has all of the changes.
This is John's Fork of Equinox. It exists as the *current* place as of 9/18/2023 to work on grappling.
### Enjoy

Surviving space is tough. Surviving after your spaceship is torn to pieces by a barrage of meteors. Well, it is even tougher. In this First Person Puzzler Platformer, you see yourself having to reassemble the wreckage of the Equinox, where due to the lack of gravity (who knew), your only means of traversal is a trusty grapple hook. You will have to attach yourself to asteroids and all kinds of ship debris. Working against the dizziness of space movement and 0G physics, all in the hopes to reconstruct the Equinox once again and kiss this Solar System goodbye.

Built on Unity Version: 2022.3.5f1.
